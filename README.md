<h1> Discovering Exoplanets </h1>

This project was made to complete the credits for the discipline of Neural Networks in the master's program in Applied Computing at PPGIA/UFRPE. 
Como tive que apresentar um experimento e um artigo, este repositório mostrará os dois trabalhos. 

It will present an introduction to Neural Networks and the database used by NASA's Kepler Observatory and made available on Kaggle. 

<h3>Introduction</h3>

In 2009 the Kepler Space Observatory was launched by NASA, with the aim to answer the question: ”How frequent are other Earths in our galaxy?” [2]. The observatory is on its second mission since 2014, and had labeled more than 10, 000 possible exoplanets [3].

Kepler scanned 1,284 new exoplanets in 2016. As in 2017, there were more than 3,000 exoplanets confirmed in total (using all detection meth- ods, including ground-based ones). The observatory still works and keep on searching for other exoplanets [3].

Our goal with this project is to use the data collected by the Kepler Space Observatory during all these years and build a Neural Networks model solution that, given the characteristics collected by Kepler, is feasible to identify exoplanets.

<h3>Artificial Neural Network</h3>

Artificial Neural Networks are parallel composed of simple units that calculate a certain mathematical function. These units are distributed in one or more layers so that they produce a large number of connections. In most of the models these connections are associated with weights, where they store the knowledge represented in the model and serve to weight the incoming input for each neuron of the network [4].

The figure 1 displays a biological neuron structure that corresponds to a neural network node. In a neuron the information is received by the den- drites, they pass through the cell body and go to the cellular nucleus, where the information is processed, finally an impulse containing the information is transmitted by the axon to other neurons [5].
